Happy Valentine’s Day, Love ❤️😘

Digital muna tayo ngayon hahahahahaha. 

Virtual kiss.
Virtual flowers.
Walang virtual hugs eh XDDDD

Kung may teleport feature lang ang buhay, nanjan na ako sa tabi mo ngayon. Kung parang file transfer lang ang distance, drag and drop na kita sa harap ko. But for now, naka long distance mode muna tayo and it sucks 😣😣😣😣.

And even if it’s digital, what I feel for you is real love. No buffering. No delay.

First of all love, I’m sorry love I can’t be there with you this Valentine’s Day 🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹.

I really wish I was beside you right now. Holding your hand. Pulling you closer. Feeling you rest against me. Saying “I love you” habang ramdam ko yung warmth mo love.....

I miss you so damn much love....

yung miss na super bigat sa damdamin love....

Yung bigla bigla ka nalang papasok sa isip ko habang may ginagawa ako tapos mapapahinto ako. Yung gusto kitang yakapin ng mahigpit agad love kahit imposible sa moment na ‘yon and it hurts.

I miss kissing you love.
I miss cuddling you love.
I miss our intimate moments love.
I miss the way you fit perfectly in my arms love.
I miss holding you close and not wanting to let go love.
I miss slow mornings na magkatabi lang tayo, half-asleep, na ayaw nating bumangon love.
I miss kissing your forehead love.
I miss brushing your hair away from your face love.
I miss the way you look at me love.
I miss how you take care of me love.
I miss how you comfort me love.
I miss how you make me feel loved love.
I miss how you make me feel special love.
I miss how you make me feel safe love while holding you love.

I miss you love.

But babawi ako pagdating ko diyan. Don’t worry, love.

When I say babawi ako, I really really mean it. (Actually may regalo ka saakin ngayon love bigay ko pag anjan na ako love hahahaha)

You know me love I don’t promise things lightly. I don’t say sweet words just to fill the space. I move with intention.

So wait for me there love.

Not because I’m unsure.

But because I’m coming jan >.<.

You know I’m still applying right now. Still sending resumes. Still checking emails. Still preparing for interviews. Pressured. Inip na inip na. May moments na tahimik lang ako because I’m thinking kung ano susunod?

Tapos yung mga unpaid debts ng clients ko love, ang sarap sarap nilang tadjakan loveeeeee anjan na sana ako ngayon kung nakabayad mga yonnnnnnn 😾😾😾😾😾.

Not because of the money lang.

But because I delivered it properly. I gave effort. I gave time. And hindi sila nagbabayad ontime di tuloy ako naka punta diyan love 🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹.

And nakaka frustrate talaga love 🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹.

But even on those stressed days, even when I’m quiet and focused, even when I’m mentally running calculations kung ano susunod kong gagawin welll love

Ikaw yung pahinga ko.

You’re my peace love.

You’re my home love......

When life feels like League early game, slow farm. Pero as of now, sa’kin I’m getting poked real hard and waiting to get that power spike para makabawi. Waiting to crash my minions at ive been freezing, so I stay patient. I scale, and I don’t surrender.

And when it comes to you, love… hehe.

I don’t even hesitate, love. There is no second option.

Because I love you, Honeyleth. I really, really, really, really really really really really do.

Not just surface level.
Hindi na sinasabi lang.
Hindi lang pakilig.
Hindi lang ngayong Valentine’s.

The kind of love that chooses every single day, love…

And I do... love

I choose you love every single day even in good times and in bad times or in happy and in sad times I will always choose you love.

If love was engineering, you’re not a temporary patch or side module. You’re the core architecture. Integrated into the main system. Hindi ka optional feature. Hindi ka beta version.

You’re the stable and final release.

If love was League, Queue up in ranked, Accept, Lock in long term climb. no /ff @15. No surrender. No tilting. Just pure focus and determination.

And if love was an operation? Then I move tactically.

If love was a distance, I’d travel it no matter how far.

If love was a job, I’d work overtime just to prove I deserve you.

If love was a mission, I commit fully. No half execution.

If love was territory, I secure it quietly.

If love was a direction, I’m already walking towards you.

If love was something valuable, I don’t leave it exposed.

If love was positioning, I place myself where I can protect what matters.

If love was loyalty, mine doesn’t shake under pressure.

If love was a risk, I’d take it with no hesitation (Basta ikaw yung reward love nyahahahaha).

If love was a long-term investment, I already chose where to put all my resources (and that is you love).

If love was code, you’re the one I don’t refactor out of my life kasi ikaw ang main function ko love.

If love was a map, ikaw yung destination ko kahit gaano pa kahaba yung journey.

If love was choosing every day, I’d still choose you and I don’t share what I commit to.

//well love yan lang naisip kong cheesy lines (pero gagawin ko yan)hahahahahahaha 😣😣😣😣😂😂😂😂😂

When I say you’re mine, you’re mine love [AKIN KA LANG LOVE{Walang magtatangkag papasok sa bakod ko sayo love (ikkatek ulu na nuka agijay hmmmp😾😾😾)hahahahaha}]

I don’t rotate.
I don’t replace.
I don’t entertain alternatives.

I stay sayo lang love iyong iyo lang ako.

And I protect what is rightfully mine even if it means sacrificing myself.

And living together soon diyan love, kasama kita love 😊😘😚😚😚

I always keep on imagining waking up beside you love…  watching you sleep brush your hair away from your face and I gently kissing your forehead hugging you after that...

I imagine us working on our laptops in the same room. You, fully focused and serious. (I love it when you're focused love)
Me, pretending to focus… but actually just stealing glances at you because you look so beautiful when you're focused love. (Even sa video call love nyahahahahaha)
I imagine walking up behind you while you’re cooking, wrapping my arms around your waist, resting my chin on your shoulder. (I want to experience this love >.<)
I imagine quiet nights where you’re lying on my chest, your breathing slow, everything calm… and in that moment, nothing else in the world matters. (I miss this love >.<)
That’s where I see us going love.

Right nowwww love, digital muna tayo hahahahaha.
Temporary lang muna to love.

Parang placeholder variable lang sa code declared, active, pero hindi pa final build hahahahaha.

Andddd about our label naman love…

Kailan mo ba ako sasagutin, Honeyleth??????? XD

Application status kay Honeyleth: still pending sa label?
May final interview pa ba ako love? Nyahahahahahahaha.

But honestly love… even without the formal announcement, we both know naman na seryoso tayo sa isa’t isa.

And I know na totoo itong saatin love.

waiting for that right date and time lang talaga love yung feel mo na yun na and I'll wait for that moment love.

And kahit ngayon love hindi pa tayo official love. (pero feel ko official na tayo love nyahahahahaha)
I will make you the most happiest woman in the world love and I will always be there for you no matter what.
I will love you and cherish you and take care of you and protect you and always be there for you no matter what the cost.
I will be one of the best decision in your life love and I will be the best partner in your life love. (Literal na abot langit ang ngiti at tatalon talon ako love pag sinagot mo na ako love nyahahahahaha)

Pero love we both know na mahal natin ang isa't isa. and that's real love...

You matter to me more than you probably realize.
More than I probably show sometimes love.

And even though I can’t be there physically today love, 

imagine this nalang love hahaha
Imagine me standing behind you, slowly wrapping my arms around you tapos kissing you slowly.
Imagine me kissing your forehead gently, like you’re something precious.
Imagine me whispering “I love you” close to your ear, soft and sure.
Imagine me kissing you passionately and not letting you go.
Because that’s exactly what I would be doing love.

Happy Valentine’s Day, love.

Next time, hindi na through screen.
Next time, adta nak tu abay mu nga naka dikket lattan love hahahahaha

Real hugs.
Real cuddles.
Real kisses.
Real life together natin love.

And when I finally deploy myself beside you?

I’m not gonna let you go not even for a second love.

Because I’ve waited for that moment.
Because no matter how far we are right now, it doesn't matter love as long as we have each other.
Because you’re worth every second we spend apart.
Because when I finally get to you again love, I’m holding you tighter and never letting you go.

I keep choosing you love and I will always choose you love.
I love you Honeyleth so much more than words can say.
TJ ❤️
